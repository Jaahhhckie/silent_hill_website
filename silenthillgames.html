    <p class="team-silent-info"> The following includes the original four games crafted by Team Silent, 
                                the visionary development team behind Silent Hill. These titles—Silent Hill, 
                                Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill 3, and Silent Hill 4: The Room—stand as the collective work of 
                                Team Silent before the team disbanded in 2005. Their unique contributions to atmospheric storytelling, 
                                psychological horror, and game design define the classic Silent Hill experience that fans cherish.
